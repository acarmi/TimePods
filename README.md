> "A KOAN 
   DURING A LESSON, THE MASTER EXPLAINED THE I
   'THE I IS THE VOICE OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE,' HE SAID
   WHEN ASKED BY A STUDENT TO EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANT; 
   THE MASTER SAID 'IT IS A VOICE INSIDE YOUR HEAD'
   'I DON'T HAVE A VOICE IN MY HEAD,' THOUGHT THE STUDENT, 
   AND HE RAISED HIS HAND TO TELL THE MASTER
   THE MASTER STOPPED THE STUDENT, AND SAID 
   'THE VOICE THAT JUST SAID YOU HAVE NO VOICE IN YOUR HEAD; 
   IS THE I'
   AND THE STUDENTS WERE ENLIGHTENED"
